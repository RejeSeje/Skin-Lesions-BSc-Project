Group-number,What do they measure?,"How clear is the code? (0-2) - cant run, need some work, perfect",Which model(s),How clear are the methods? (0-2),(Good) references?,Other?,Evaluation:
Group 1,"Asymmetry, colour, border ",1: Can't run because of PATH error,"Logistic regression, knn","1: Good description and figures, but no direct references to code",,More false negatives than false positives. Normalised features (which we don't want),
Group 2,"Assymetry, colour","1: Can't figure out how to run, uses ipynb file",knn,"1: Fairly descriptive, but strange data collection",,"Was the one we all read. Not great report nor results, probably wouldn't recommend",
Group 3,"Assymtery, colour",0: Deleted Github?,knn,"2: Good description and models, with references to code libraries used",Literally no references lol,Uses a lot of words to explain simple machine learning concepts and not a lot exploring interesting things for further work,
Group 4,"Diameter (Compactness), colour, assymetry","1: Code makes sense, but README has no explanation as to how to run it","Logistic regression, knn",2: Great description and visualisation,"The HAM10000 dataset, a large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions.  PyPi library to evaluate skin tones https://pypi.org/project/derm-ita/","Actually mentions fitzpatrickscale, and calculates the distribution, but doesn't use this data for anything","Good segmentation, and good code"
Group 5,"Atypical pigment network, Blue whitish veil, Atypical vascular pattern, Irregular dots/globules, Irregular streaks, Irregular pigmentation, Regression structures",1: Could not make it run ,"Logistic regression, knn, decisiont tree classifier","1: Says what they do, but don't go into too much detail","Other methods than ABCDE: Validity and reliability of dermoscopic criteria used to differentiate
nevi from melanoma. JAMA Dermatology, 152:798",Uses 7-point checklist instead of ABCDE.,"Good code and report, uses 7-point"
Group 6,"asymmetry, colour","1: it can run, but need to download some libs and change directories, otherwise good. very long scripts, but managable","knn, logistic regression, random forest, nearest centroid",2: lots of details,2020.41.00,found colour by using simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC algorithm). RFC accuracy of 77%. would recommend this one,"Good code, runs no problem, clear explanation (pretty long), "
Group 7,"asymmetry, border, colour","0: get system error, i cant seem to fix, very annoying",knn,"1: says what they do, but not as much in detail as the previous group",,"good report, but maybe not use this group's code",
Group 8,"asymmetry, colour, diameter","0: no notebook is insane (imo). raises errors once again. maybe i am too dumb to get it to run, but it shouldn't be this difficult","logistic regression, knn","1: says what they do, but again, not so descriptive",Skin cancer and deep learning for dermoscopic images classification: A pilot study.,"Fine report, but sucks that the code can't run",
Group 9,"asymmetry, colour, diameter (compactness), convexity?","2: easy to run, no need to do anythinf for it to run","logistic regression, knn","2: very descriptive, especially in terms of where to look in the code",,logistic regression accuracy of 74-78%. would recommend this one,"easy to run, very descriptive (also for their code), uses methods we do not know (deep and wide data)"
Group 10,"asymmetry, colour, border, (compactness), ",2: nicely organised and good comments,"logistic, knn, decision","1: very descriptive, but often not nicely forumlated, tells you abou what they tried but didnt work, which makes a lot of the text not releant for us","Ali, Abder-Rahman, et al. “Towards the Automatic Detection of Skin Lesion Shape Asymmetry, Color Variegation and Diameter in Dermoscopic Images.”","some good methods, nicely organisted code, but the color feature extraction did not seem good",
Group 11,"shape (compactness,symmetry, elongation,roundness, bordersharpness), colour","1: need some work, i do not get any errors, but nothing happens when I run main","logistic, KNN, SVM","1: not too many details, but very consise ",(Abbasi et al. 2004),"good methods, seems like something that could be really good, but the report isn't great",
Group 12,"asymmetry, colour, border, texture",No code at all,"KNN, NN, decision tree, ","1: not great, maybe a 0, it sounds like their methods are good, but they do not explain them very well",,"read it sallowly, their github is down, so we cannot even get the code",
Group 13,"asymmetry, border (compactness), colour, ","1: something is wrong with the paths, dont wanna spend too long trying to fix it, i think it will run if we can fix that","KNN, NN, decision tree, ",2: simple and descriptive,,"their methods were explained nicely, but the whole set up were confusing",
Group 14,"height, width, diameter, area, perimeter, asymmetry, compactness, color","1: no main, just different scripts",knn,0: not many details,,"not a good feeling, no main, and no reasoning for the features chosen. Their colour method seemed fine, but the rest was shallow",
